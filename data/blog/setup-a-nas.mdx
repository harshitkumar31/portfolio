I was tired of using cloud storage solutions and wanted to set up my own Network Attached Storage (NAS) at home.
I also wanted to peek behind the curtains of how an app like Google photos works, where you can upload your photos and access them from anywhere.
After some research, I decided to use a Raspberry Pi for this purpose. 
This article will guide you through the steps to set up your own NAS using a Raspberry Pi.
It will also guide you through the process of setting up OpenMediaVault, CasaOs, Immich and Tailscale on your Raspberry Pi.
All of these are quite easy to set up and will give you the ability to access your photos from anywhere.

## Prerequisites
- A Raspberry Pi (I used a Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM)
