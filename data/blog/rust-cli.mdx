I recently wanted to create a CLI for personal use. Because I was feeling adventurous I went with writing it in Rust.

I've documented how to create a CLI through this post, it uses GraphQL APIs to fetch some dynamic content, so this might be helpful
if you want to know how to use a GraphQL client in Rust.

### Prerequisites

* Rust - https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

### Setup a new Rust project

```bash
cargo new cli_demo
```

### Adding dependencies

Add the following to the `Cargo.toml` dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
anyhow = { version = "1.0.94" } # Used for creating Errors
clap = { version = "4.0", features = ["derive"] } # CLI Argument Parser
dialoguer = "0.11.0" # Interactive User Inputs
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] } # Used for async programming
cynic = { version = "3", features = ["http-surf"] } # GraphQL client for rust
surf = "2" # HTTP client framework
indicatif = "0.17.9" # Progress Bar for CLI
```

We'll touch on each of these dependencies as we make progress.
