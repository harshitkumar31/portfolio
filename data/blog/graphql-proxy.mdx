I needed to create a proxy server for my GraphQL service to be able to make some decisions before reaching my service.

This article will document how you can do the same with minimal amount of code 😏
We'll be leveraging awesome utilities provided by [graphql-tools](https://www.graphql-tools.com/)

## Installation

```bash
npm init -y
npm i @graphql-tools/delegate @graphql-tools/utils @graphql-tools/wrap apollo-server cross-undici-fetch graphql typescript
```

## Create an [executor](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/remote-schemas#creating-an-executor) 

Executor is a function used capable of retrieving GraphQL results (both introspection & fetching results during a query's execution).

In the executor, I've defined the GraphQL service's URL which I want to proxy - https://graphql.anilist.co/ (an open API to fetch your favourite Anime characters)

```typescript
const executor =  async ({ document , variables, context }: {document: any, variables: any, context: any}) => {
    const query = print(document)
  const fetchResult = await fetch('https://graphql.anilist.co/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      ...context?.headers
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables })
  })
  return fetchResult.json()
}
```

Define applicationProxyResolver

This function is passed to `wrapSchema` method. In this method, you should be able to make some decisions. For example - I wanted to validate some headers & only honour the requests if they had these headers. We'll use `delegateToSchema` to delegate the entire request to our original GraphQL service.

```typescript
export const applicationProxyResolver = ({
    subschemaConfig,
    operation,
    transformedSchema,
}: {
    subschemaConfig: any,
    operation: any,
    transformedSchema: any,
}) => {
    return (_parent: any, _args: any, context: any, info: any) => {
        return delegate.delegateToSchema({
            schema: subschemaConfig,
            operation,
            operationName: info!.operation!.name!.value,
            context,
            info,
            transformedSchema,
        });
    };
}
```

Let's fire up the graphQL proxy server 🚀

```typescript
const init = async () => {
    const schema = wrapSchema({
        schema: await introspectSchema(executor),
        executor,
        createProxyingResolver: applicationProxyResolver
    });
    
    const server = new ApolloServer({ 
        schema,
    });
    
    // The `listen` method launches a web server.
    server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
        console.log(`🚀  Server ready at ${url}`);
    });
    
}

init();
```

Is there an easier way to do this? Please comment & let me know 😁
